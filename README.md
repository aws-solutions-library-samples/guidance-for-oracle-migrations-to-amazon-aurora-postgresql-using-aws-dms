## Overview

This guidance demonstrates how to efficiently migrate very large tables from Oracle to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The guidance leverages multiple DMS tasks that have been preconfigured for high performance for both the full load and CDC stages of the migration. Users can further tune DMS parameters for their particular workload, but this provides a very good starting point for large databases. Included sample code contains a Cloudformation template that builds out the entire environment, including the Oracle database, DMS Infrastructure, DMS tasks, and Aurora PostgreSQL database.

### Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance.

As of 09/09/2024, the cost for running this guidance with the default settings in the US-West-2 (Oregon) is approximately $19,596.97 per month.

The cloudformation template takes inputs on the size of instances used, so this can be scaled up or down as needed. It also does not need to be run for a full month to understand the guidance and apply it to your particular workload.

We recommend creating a Budget through AWS Cost Explorer to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this Guidance.

The following table provides a sample cost breakdown for deploying this Guidance with the default parameters in the US-West-2 (Oregon) Region for one month.

| AWS service  | Dimensions | Monthly Cost [USD] |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Amazon RDS for Oracle | 16.xl and 5 TB Storage | $6,017.88 |
| Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL | 16.xl and 5 TB Storage | $7,729.01 |
| DMS Replication Instance | 16.xl and 500 GB Storage | 5,326.11 | 
| Amazon EC2 | m5.4xl | 523.97 | 

## Prerequisites 

- Access to deploy Cloudformation template and create resources (Amazon EC2, Aurora PostgreSQL, RDS Oracle, VPC, Subnets, Security groups, IAM roles and Policies)

### Operating System 

- These deployment instructions are optimized to best work on **<Amazon Linux 2023 AMI>** which is deployed for you on the bastion host.


### AWS account requirements 

This deployment requires that you have access to the following AWS services:

- Amazon RDS
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- Amazon VPC
- AWS IAM role 
- AWS Cloudformation

### Supported Regions 

This guidance is supported in all AWS Regions


## Deployment Steps


 
**Example:**

1. Clone the repo using command ```git clone xxxxxxxxxx```
2. cd to the repo folder ```cd <repo-name>```
3. Install packages in requirements using command ```pip install requirement.txt```
4. Edit content of **file-name** and replace **s3-bucket** with the bucket name in your account.
5. Run this command to deploy the stack ```cdk deploy``` 
6. Capture the domain name created by running this CLI command ```aws apigateway ............```



## Deployment Validation  (required)

<Provide steps to validate a successful deployment, such as terminal output, verifying that the resource is created, status of the CloudFormation template, etc.>


**Examples:**

* Open CloudFormation console and verify the status of the template with the name starting with xxxxxx.
* If deployment is successful, you should see an active database instance with the name starting with <xxxxx> in        the RDS console.
*  Run the following CLI command to validate the deployment: ```aws cloudformation describe xxxxxxxxxxxxx```



## Running the Guidance (required)

<Provide instructions to run the Guidance with the sample data or input provided, and interpret the output received.> 

This section should include:

* Guidance inputs
* Commands to run
* Expected output (provide screenshot if possible)
* Output description


## Next Steps (required)

Provide suggestions and recommendations about how customers can modify the parameters and the components of the Guidance to further enhance it according to their requirements.


## Cleanup (required)

- Include detailed instructions, commands, and console actions to delete the deployed Guidance.
- If the Guidance requires manual deletion of resources, such as the content of an S3 bucket, please specify.



## FAQ, known issues, additional considerations, and limitations (optional)


**Known issues (optional)**

<If there are common known issues, or errors that can occur during the Guidance deployment, describe the issue and resolution steps here>


**Additional considerations (if applicable)**

<Include considerations the customer must know while using the Guidance, such as anti-patterns, or billing considerations.>

**Examples:**

- “This Guidance creates a public AWS bucket required for the use-case.”
- “This Guidance created an Amazon SageMaker notebook that is billed per hour irrespective of usage.”
- “This Guidance creates unauthenticated public API endpoints.”


Provide a link to the *GitHub issues page* for users to provide feedback.
